## Description

Generate changelogs from a project's commit messages and metadata using composer and automate versioning with [semver](https://semver.org) and [conventional-commits](https://conventionalcommits.org).

This package can generate changelog and release notes from committing history.
It provides a command that can be run from the terminal, or using composer scripts, to generate a changelog file in markdown for the current project.

The command may take parameters that define the releases of the project that will be considered to extract the changes from the git history to generate the file.
The package uses a configuration system with that permit to customize the settings you may want to have your desired changelog generated.

## ðŸ’» Usage

> **Note:** all following commands must be run (working dir) on the root of the project or in the path where the changelog should be generated

The changelog generator will generate a log of changes from the date of the last tag *(if not specified with `--from-date`)* to the current date *(if not specified with `--to-date`)*,
and it will put all commit logs in the latest version just created (at the moment it doesn't generate the entire git commit version release history).
By default, will be added one to the patch semver part *(Example, if the last version is `1.0.2` the newer, if not specified the identity of the release, will be `1.0.3`)*.

- To generate your changelog for your first release:
  
  > **Note:** If the version code (`--ver`) isn't specified it will be automatically `1.0.0`

  `php vendor/bin/conventional-changelog --first-release`


- To generate your changelog without committing files:
  
    `php vendor/bin/conventional-changelog`


- To generate your changelog with auto commit and auto version tagging:

    `php vendor/bin/conventional-changelog --commit`


- To generate your changelog from a specified date to another specified date:

    `php vendor/bin/conventional-changelog --from-date="2020-12-01" --to-date="2021-01-01"`


- To generate your changelog with a specific version code:

  `php vendor/bin/conventional-changelog --ver="2.0.1"`


- To generate your changelog with the entire history of changes of all releases:

  > **Warn:** This operation will overwrite the `CHANGELOG.md` file if it already exists

  `php vendor/bin/conventional-changelog --history`
